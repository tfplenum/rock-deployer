Role Name
=========

This role is to automate the configuration of a kickstart server for RPM-based (rhel,centos) operating systems.

Requirements
------------

The user of this role will need access to the installation iso file and will need to copy it to the target node.

Role Variables
--------------

The settable variables for this role are in defaults/main.yml
```
The absolute path to the installation .iso file. ex: /root/rhel-7-server-x86_64.iso
iso_path: 

Define a short name for the kickstart media. ex: rhel7.4
kick_media:

Remove the iso from the system? Override to "true" to keep.
keep_iso: false

Keep local yum repo or delete it? Override to "true" to keep.
keep_repo: false

Keep iso mounted? Override to "true" to keep.
keep_mnt: false
```
If you would like to configure DHCP services, set this to "true"; Please note that the subnet used during DHCP scope creation is the default IPv4 address (eth0) of the target system. For example, if your eth0 network information is 192.168.124.200/24, DHCP will be configured for 192.168.124.0/255.255.255.0. To override you will need to update kick_srvr, dhcp_net and dhcp_mask variables.
```
dhcp: false

If DHCP is enabled, define the starting IP address of the scope.
dhcp_start:

If DHCP is enabled, define the last IP address of the scope.
dhcp_end:
```

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
